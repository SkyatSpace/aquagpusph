/** @brief Renormalize the differential operators.
 *
 * The main drawback of the boundary integrals formulation is the requirement
 * of the renormalization of the computed differentiqal operators, which is
 * destroying several conservation properties.
 *
 * @param imove Moving flags.
 *   - imove > 0 for regular fluid particles.
 *   - imove = 0 for sensors.
 *   - imove < 0 for boundary elements/particles.
 * @param shepard Shepard term
 * \f$ \gamma(\mathbf{x}) = \int_{\Omega}
 *     W(\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{x}) \mathrm{d}\mathbf{x} \f$.
 * @param grad_p Pressure gradient \f$ \frac{\nabla p}{rho} \f$.
 * @param lap_u Velocity laplacian \f$ \frac{\Delta \mathbf{u}}{rho} \f$.
 * @param div_u Velocity divergence \f$ \rho \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} \f$.
 * @param N Total number of particles and boundary elements.
 * @param cs Speed of sound \f$ c_s \f$.
